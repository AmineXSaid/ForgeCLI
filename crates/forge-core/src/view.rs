//! A read-only view of the session, for commands that run while a turn is in
//! progress (contract C17, "Immediate commands": `/status`, `/usage`,
//! `/tasks`, `/context`, `/mcp`, `/btw`).
//!
//! A turn holds the [`Driver`](crate::Driver) mutably, so these commands read
//! a [`SessionView`] instead. It has two parts:
//! - the driver's ([`ViewState`]): session facts, activity, side questions,
//!   subtask rows and the shared handles (permissions, runtime, scheduler,
//!   background shells, MCP), published by the driver when idle, between the
//!   turns of one input and after a session switch;
//! - the engine's ([`forge_engine::EngineSnapshot`]), published by the engine
//!   after each model call and tool batch and at the end of a turn, reached
//!   through the engine handle in [`ViewState`].
//!
//! Both are `Arc`s replaced whole: a reader clones the `Arc` and drops the lock
//! at once, so no guard is held for long and never across `.await`.
//!
//! What a command can't do through the view (record `/btw`'s cost and its
//! exchange, refresh what the session derives from MCP servers) is recorded
//! as an [`Effect`]. The driver applies effects when it is next free
//! ([`crate::Driver::sync_view`]): at the end of the turn, or at once when idle.
