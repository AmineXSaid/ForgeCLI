//! `/subtask` (contract C20): forked background sub-agents.
//!
//! A subtask starts from the whole conversation so far: the same system prompt, tools and
//! messages, so its first request reads the main conversation's prompt cache. It runs on its
//! own tokio task while the person keeps going, never asks for permission, and is handed back
//! the next time the session is idle: its spend joins the session's, the person gets a notice,
//! a host gets `system/subtask`, and its report rides along with the next prompt (in `-p`, one
//! more turn).
