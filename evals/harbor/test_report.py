"""Tests for report.py's verdicts, run without Harbor, Docker or an endpoint.

    python3 -m pytest evals/harbor/test_report.py

The one that matters here: a trial where the verifier's own test phase could not
fetch its packages or data (a cert/network failure behind a TLS-inspecting proxy)
is set apart as "verifier error", not counted as the agent failing, while a trial
whose tests actually ran and failed stays "false success". The fixtures are cut
down from real terminal-bench 2.0 verifier logs (pytorch-model-cli, write-compressor,
gpt2-codegolf) on the KPIT endpoint.
